This is a sample code, developed using code reference from HuggingFace and Langchain coding exercises. The ```using_TrainerModel.py``` is the starting point of this code, which takes an existing pre_trained model and then using existing dataset retrain the model on subset of data and we see how the new model perform on the same task of text-generation.
