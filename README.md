This is a sample code, developed using code reference from HuggingFace and Langchain coding exercises. The ```using_TrainerModel.py``` is the starting point of this code, which takes an existing pre_trained model and then using existing dataset retrain the model on subset of data and we see how the new model perform on the same task of text-generation.
### Python version used
This was developed on python 3.10
### Installation 
```pip install -f requirements.txt ```
once the installation is over then 
``` python perft.py ```
### code in action 
The above code is going to generate a new model based on the base model and the dataset provided to train a new model with small dataset 
### using the trained model 
``` python using_TrainerModel.py ```
